# 2-dimensional  spatial indexing using KdTree

KdTree collection is simplified implementation of KdTree, which supports the following operations:

1.  Create a new, empty collection.
2. Add a single point (x,y) to the collection.
3. Given a  query point (x,y) find the point in the collection which is g  eometrically closest
to the query point.


See KdTreeTest for examples. Use

```
mvn clean test 
```

to run the tests from command line.
